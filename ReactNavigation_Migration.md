## React Navigation Migration: Summary of Changes

### Overview
This document summarizes the key changes made to transition the ToDo-App from useState-based navigation to React Navigation.

---

### 1. Removed useState-based Navigation
- All navigation logic using useState (e.g., `screen`, `setScreen`, `setId`, `setListType`) was removed from `App.js` and all screen/components.
- Props related to manual navigation were removed from `HomeScreen`, `ListPage`, and any other components.

### 2. Integrated React Navigation
- Added `@react-navigation/native` and `@react-navigation/native-stack` for navigation.
- Set up a `Stack.Navigator` in `App.js` with three screens: Home, EditTask, and ListPage.
- Used the `navigation` and `route` props provided by React Navigation to move between screens and pass parameters.

### 3. Refactored Components
- Removed all legacy navigation props and state from `HomeScreen`, `ListPage`, and `TaskList`.
- Updated `TaskList` to use an `onPressItem` prop that triggers navigation using React Navigation.
- Cleaned up `ListItem` to remove unnecessary local state and toggle logic, making it controlled by the parent.

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Removed the default header from all screens for a cleaner look using `headerShown: false` in the stack navigator.
- Ensured consistent background color and styling across all screens.

### 5. Efficiency and Clarity
- Reduced prop drilling and unnecessary state management.
- All navigation and modal logic is now handled at the screen level or via React Navigation, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

**The app is now fully powered by React Navigation, with a cleaner, more maintainable, and more scalable codebase.**
